# Data Analyst

Welcome to My Portfolio!

I am Manish, a motivated and detail-oriented data analyst passionate about leveraging data to uncover actionable insights and solve complex business problems. With a robust foundation in data analysis, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful, data-driven solutions.

I bring proficiency in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI and EDA techniques, enabling me to analyze diverse datasets and deliver insights that support strategic decision-making. My hands-on experience in tackling real-world projects has honed my ability to work with large datasets, apply statistical analysis, and create impactful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

I am eager to collaborate with organizations that value data-driven decision-making and foster professional development. My ultimate goal is to utilize my analytical skills to deliver measurable results and, over time, transition into a Data Scientist role, further enhancing my contributions to predictive modeling and machine learning.

Explore my portfolio to discover how my expertise in data analytics and commitment to continuous learning can add value to your team. If you are looking for a dedicated, results-oriented professional, I would be delighted to discuss how I can contribute to your organization's success.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
